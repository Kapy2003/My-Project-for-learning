# Taking Input, Output, and Using `sizeof` in C

This folder contains example C programs demonstrating how to:

- Take user input using `scanf`
- Display output using `printf`
- Use the `sizeof` operator to determine the size of data types and variables

## Contents

- Basic usage of `scanf` for reading different data types (int, float, char, etc.)
- Examples using `printf` for formatted output
- Demonstrations of `sizeof` to show the size (in bytes) of various data types and user-defined variables

## How to Use

1. Open any of the `.c` files in this directory.
2. Compile the code using a C compiler, such as GCC:
   ```bash
   gcc filename.c -o filename
   ```
3. Run the compiled program:
   ```bash
   ./filename
   ```

## Learning Objectives

- Understand how user input works in C
- Practice displaying output with formatting
- Learn how to measure memory usage of variables and types using `sizeof`

---

## Notes

- Ensure you have a C compiler installed.
- For different source file names, adjust the compile command accordingly.

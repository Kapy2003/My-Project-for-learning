# Dynamic Additions

This folder contains C code examples related to basic arithmetic operations and user input handling.

## Contents

- `additon-of-two-numbers.c`: Allows the user to add two numbers, supporting both integer and float types based on user input.

## Usage

1. Open the folder and review the available `.c` source files.
2. Compile the desired file using a C compiler, for example:
   ```
   gcc additon-of-two-numbers.c -o add_two_numbers
   ```
3. Run the compiled program:
   ```
   ./add_two_numbers
   ```

## Notes

- The examples here use standard C input/output and conditional logic.
- No dynamic memory management (`malloc`, `calloc`, or `realloc`) is used in these examples.

## Contribution

Feel free to contribute improvements, bug fixes, or additional examples related to arithmetic operations or user interaction in C.
